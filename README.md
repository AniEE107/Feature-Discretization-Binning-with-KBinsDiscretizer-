# Feature-Discretization-Binning-with-KBinsDiscretizer-
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates feature binning using KBinsDiscretizer on Titanic data. It explores 'quantile', 'uniform', and 'k-means' strategies, showing how discretization impacts feature distributions and Decision Tree classification accuracy.
