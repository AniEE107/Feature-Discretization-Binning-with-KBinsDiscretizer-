# Feature-Discretization-Binning-with-KBinsDiscretizer-
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates feature binning using KBinsDiscretizer on Titanic data. It explores 'quantile', 'uniform', and 'k-means' strategies, showing how discretization impacts feature distributions and Decision Tree classification accuracy.

#  Overview & Purpose
This Jupyter Notebook focuses on feature discretization, also known as binning, a crucial preprocessing technique in machine learning. Discretization transforms continuous numerical features into discrete, categorical bins. This can be beneficial for several reasons, such as handling outliers, improving the performance of certain models (e.g., tree-based models, naive Bayes), and making features more interpretable. This project specifically uses scikit-learn's KBinsDiscretizer to demonstrate different binning strategies on the 'Age' and 'Fare' features of the Titanic dataset.

# The primary purpose of this notebook is to:
Illustrate Binning Techniques: Provide a clear, hands-on example of how to apply various binning strategies.
Showcase KBinsDiscretizer: Demonstrate the functionality and parameters of scikit-learn's KBinsDiscretizer.
Analyze Impact on Model Performance: Compare the accuracy of a Decision Tree Classifier before and after applying binning to numerical features.
Visualize Transformed Distributions: Show how binning changes the distribution of continuous features into discrete categories.

#  Key Concepts & Functionality
The notebook covers the following aspects of feature discretization:
Data Loading & Initial Inspection: Loads the 'Survived', 'Age', and 'Fare' columns from the titanic_csv.csv dataset and performs basic checks.
Baseline Model Performance: Trains and evaluates a DecisionTreeClassifier on the original 'Age' and 'Fare' features to establish a baseline accuracy using accuracy_score and cross_val_score.

# KBinsDiscretizer Application:
Quantile Strategy: Divides features into bins such that each bin contains approximately the same number of samples.
Uniform Strategy: Divides features into bins of equal width.
K-Means Strategy: Divides features into bins based on the centroids of K-Means clusters.
Pipeline Integration (ColumnTransformer): Shows how to apply different KBinsDiscretizer instances to specific columns ('Age' and 'Fare') using ColumnTransformer, allowing for a streamlined preprocessing workflow.

# Post-Transformation Analysis:
Examines the bin edges created by the discretizer.
Creates a DataFrame to compare original feature values with their binned (ordinal encoded) counterparts.
Visualizes the distributions of 'Age' and 'Fare' before and after binning using histograms, clearly showing the effect of discretization.
Model Re-evaluation: Retrains and evaluates the DecisionTreeClassifier using the binned features to demonstrate how this transformation can affect model accuracy.
